PROJECT NAME: AI Data Usage In The Justice System

Run the RF_Prison.py to make it work


Abstract
Across the nation, judges, probation and parole officers are increasingly using
algorithms to assess a criminal defendant’s likelihood of becoming a recidivist. A tool called
COMPAS is introduced and used in many jurisdictions around the U.S. to predict if a
convicted criminal is likely to re-offend. COMPAS algorithms assign a score to each
defendant ranging from 1 to 10 with ten being the highest risk.With quantifiable data, we
could potentially build a model to predict if a criminal defendant will commit crime again or
not. Therefore, Our goal for this project is to train a model using crime history data, predict
criminal defendants’ likelihood of becoming recidivists and thus help decide which inmates
are ready for parole.
